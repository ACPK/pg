# Copy longer fields

Sample of function I'm using for people-merging:

Given two people records, copy field values from fields whose values are longer in the older than the newer one.  *(There's surely a clearer way to write that sentence!)*

New version with CASE statements thanks to <http://winand.at/>

## status:  done!
